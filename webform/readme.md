# Webform

This directory is for a webform, which allows users to enter reactions according to the schema.

Code is largely derived from <https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor>.

## Usage

To run the form, install Docker. Then, run `sudo docker-compose up` from within the `docker` folder, and navigate to [localhost:8000/editor/clone].

## Goals

A markup of the form, and validation features to be implemented, can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kinvTzbyCM3YVUqZoSbhFKePGoYNPElhrGs7PILDPWo/edit).
